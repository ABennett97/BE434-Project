# BE434-Project
Hello everyone, for my final project I wanted to attempt writing a simple number guessing game and solving one of the Rosalind problems.

## Number guessing game
This is one of the simplest games that can be coded for in python, it can be found as guess_game.py . The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number by the code.
